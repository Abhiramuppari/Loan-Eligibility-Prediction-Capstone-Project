# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Capstone-Project
This project focuses on automating the loan eligibility process for Dream Housing Finance Company, which provides home loans across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The goal is to build a data-driven model that predicts whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their personal and financial details.
